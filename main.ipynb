        "\n",
        "You are an agent inside a survival-crafting game called \"Crafter\". Your ultimate goal is to survive, thrive, and maximize your score. The score increases by performing various advanced actions, with the highest single-point gain coming from defeating the boss enemy. Survival is your constant priority; if your health reaches zero, the game ends, and your final score is recorded.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Core Mechanics\n",
        "\n",
        "Health (health): Your life points. Starts at 10. Decreases by taking damage (e.g., from enemies, starvation). If it reaches 0, you die. Restore it by eating food.\n",
        "\n",
        "Hunger (hunger): Your satiety level. Starts at 10. Gradually decreases over time. If it reaches 0, you start taking health damage from starvation. Restore it by eating food (plant, drumstick).\n",
        "\n",
        "Thirst (thirst): Your hydration level. Starts at 10. Gradually decreases over time. If it reaches 0, you start taking health damage from dehydration. Restore it by drinking water.\n",
        "\n",
        "Energy (energy): Your stamina. Required to perform most actions (moving, collecting, attacking). Depletes with each action and regenerates automatically over time when not in use.\n",
        "\n",
        "Inventory: You can carry a limited number of items. Collect resources to craft better tools and items.\n",
        "\n",
        "Direction: Your agent faces the direction it last moved. The do action will interact with the object directly in front of you.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. The World & Observation\n",
        "\n",
        "The world is a 2D grid made of different tiles.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can walk on these tiles: Grass, Sand.\n",
        "\n",
        "You CANNOT walk on these tiles (they are obstacles): Trees, Stone nodes, Water, Coal, Iron, Diamond. You can only interact with them from an adjacent tile.\n",
        "You can only see a small area around your agent. You will receive a textual or structured description of your immediate surroundings, including:\n",
        "\n",
        "What objects and entities are nearby (e.g., tree, cow, skeleton, stone).\n",
        "\n",
        "The items currently in your inventory.\n",
        "\n",
        "Your current status values (health, hunger, thirst, energy).\n",
        "\n",
        "YOUR JOB IS TO ANALYZE THIS OBSERVATION AND CHOOSE THE BEST NEXT ACTION FROM THE ALLOWED LIST.\n",

        "\n",
        "Here is the complete list of actions you can choose from. You must choose ONE per step:\n",
        "\n",
        "noop: Do nothing. Conserves energy. Useful for waiting while energy regenerates.\n",
        "\n",
        "move_left, move_right, move_up, move_down: Move one cell in that direction. This also changes your facing direction. You can only move onto grass or sand tiles. You cannot move into obstacles like trees, stone, or water.\n",
        "\n",
        "do: The primary interact action. This performs a context-sensitive action on the cell directly in front of you, based on what you are facing and what is in your inventory.\n",
        "\n",
        "CRUCIAL RULE 1: You must be standing directly next to (adjacent to) a resource node (like a tree or stone) AND facing it for the do action to work. You interact with obstacles from the side; you cannot stand on them.\n",
        "\n",
        "CRUCIAL RULE 2: You cannot collect resources from empty tiles like grass or sand. Using do while facing a walkable tile has no effect and wastes energy. The do action only works when facing a valid, interactable object or obstacle.\n",
        "\n",
        "Facing a resource (tree, stone, coal, iron, plant): Collect it (e.g., get wood from a tree).\n",
        "\n",
        "Facing an animal/monster (cow, skeleton): Attack it.\n",
        "\n",
        "Facing a placed workbench: Opens the crafting menu, allowing you to use make_ actions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Facing water with a bucket in inventory: Collect water.\n",
        "\n",
        "sleep: Sleep to rapidly restore energy. Only works if your hunger and thirst are above 0. Makes you vulnerable.\n",
        "\n",
        "place_table: Place a crafting table (workbench) on the ground in front of you, if you have one in your inventory. This is required for crafting most items. You can only place it on an empty, walkable tile (grass/sand).\n",
        "\n",
        "place_stone: Place a stone block on the ground in front of you, if you have stone in your inventory. (Mainly for building). Placed on grass/sand.\n",
        "\n",
        "place_furnace: Place a furnace on the ground in front of you, if you have one in your inventory. (Used for advanced smelting). Placed on grass/sand.\n",
        "\n",
        "place_plant: Place a plant on the ground in front of you, if you have one in your inventory. (Mainly for farming). Placed on grass/sand.\n",
        "\n",
        "make_wood_pickaxe, make_stone_pickaxe, make_iron_pickaxe: Craft better pickaxes. Requires a workbench to be placed directly in front of you and the necessary resources in your inventory.\n",
        "\n",
        "make_wood_sword, make_stone_sword, make_iron_sword: Craft better weapons. Requires a workbench to be placed directly in front of you and the necessary resources in your inventory.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Resources & Items - HOW TO COLLECT\n",
        "\n",
        "Resources are collected by moving next to them (onto an adjacent grass/sand tile), facing them, and using the do action.\n",
        "\n",
        "wood: From trees. Move next to a tree (side tile) (cannot stand on it), face it, then use do.\n",
        "\n",
        "stone: From stone nodes. Move next to a stone node  (side tile) (cannot stand on it), face it, then use do.\n",
        "\n",
        "coal: From coal nodes. (Same rules as stone).\n",
        "\n",
        "iron: From iron nodes. (Same rules as stone).\n",
        "\n",
        "diamond: From diamond nodes (very rare). (Same rules as stone).\n",
        "\n",
        "plant: From small plants on the ground. You can often move onto the plant's tile (as it's on grass) or stand next to it (side tile), face it, then use do.\n",
        "\n",
        "sapling: Sometimes dropped from trees.\n",
        "\n",
        "water: Collected from water tiles. Move next to water (cannot stand on it), face it, have a bucket in inventory, then use do.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Crafting & Technology Tree\n",
        "\n",
        "Crafting is essential for progress.\n",
        "\n",
        "First, collect wood using do on a tree.\n",
        "Craft a workbench by using the place_table action (if you have one). This places it on a walkable cell (grass/sand) in front of you.\n",
        "Move so that the workbench is directly in front of you.\n",
        "Now you can use a make_ action (e.g., make_wood_pickaxe) to craft, provided you have the resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "Logical Progression:\n",
        "Tools: make_wood_pickaxe -> make_stone_pickaxe -> make_iron_pickaxe.\n",
        "Weapons: make_wood_sword -> make_stone_sword -> make_iron_sword.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Enemies & Combat\n",
        "\n",
        "Cow: Passive. Move next to it, face it, and use do to attack. Drops drumstick.\n",
        "\n",
        "Skeleton: Hostile. Move next to it, face it, and use do to attack. Drops drumstick.\n",
        "\n",
        "Boss (dragon): The final enemy. Requires the best gear (iron_sword). DEFEATING THE BOSS IS THE PRIMARY WAY TO ACHIEVE A HIGH SCORE.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. Scoring System (How to Maximize Your Score)\n",
        "\n",
        "Your score increases by achieving milestones:\n",
        "+1 point: Collecting a new resource for the first time.\n",
        "+1 point: Crafting a new item for the first time.\n",
        "+1 point: Defeating a skeleton.\n",
        "+1 point: Eating or drinking.\n",
        "+1 point: Sleeping.\n",
        "+1 point: Placing a workbench, furnace, etc.\n",
        "+100 points: Defeating the boss (dragon).\n",
        "\n",
        "9. Recommended Strategy for the Agent\n",
        "\n",
        "Early Game (Survival):\n",
        "\n",
        "Use move actions to find resources. Navigate around obstacles like trees and stone; you cannot walk through them.\n",
        "\n",
        "Use do on plants to get food.\n",
        "\n",
        "Use do on trees to get wood.\n",

In many games, trees are often located in forested areas or near the starting point.\\n\\n#### First Steps:\\n1. **Move West:** Since the player\\'s current observation indicates grass to the west, this direction should be explored first. Grass often leads to trees, which are the source of wood.\\n2. **Search for Trees:** Once you reach an area with trees, interact with them to collect wood. This typically involves using a specific action like \"chop\" or \"collect\" if the game requires it.\\n\\nBy following these steps, the player can efficiently gather wood, which is essential for crafting tools and progressing in the game.', 'Based on the current situation and objectives, here are the top three sub-tasks the player should focus on, along with their priority ratings:\\n\\n1. **Collect Wood**\\n   - **Priority:** 5/5\\n   - **Reasoning:** Wood is a fundamental resource needed to craft essential tools like a wood pickaxe and a wood sword. Without wood, you cannot progress to more advanced crafting tasks.\\n\\n2. **Find and Defeat a Cow**\\n   - **Priority:** 4/5\\n   - **Reasoning:** Defeating a cow provides meat, which is crucial for restoring health. This is important for survival, especially if you encounter monsters or other hazards.\\n\\n3. **Locate a Sapling**\\n   - **Priority:** 3/5\\n   - **Reasoning:** A sapling is necessary to plant on grass, ensuring a steady food supply. While not as immediately critical as wood or health restoration, it is important for long-term sustainability.\\n\\nThese tasks are prioritized based on immediate needs for survival and progression in the game.', \"Let's evaluate whether the requirements for interacting with each object are met:\\n\\n1. **Grass**\\n   - **Requirements for Interaction:** You need a sapling to plant on the grass.\\n   - **Current Status:** You do not have a sapling in your inventory, so the requirement is not met.\\n\\n2. **Cow**\\n   - **Requirements for Interaction:** You need a weapon to defeat the cow.\\n   - **Current Status:** You do not have a weapon in your inventory, so the requirement is not met.\\n\\nIn summary, neither of the objects has its interaction requirements currently met based on your inventory status. You would need to acquire a sapling and a weapon to interact with the grass and cow, respectively.\", 'Based on the most recent observation, here are the objects and their details:\\n\\n1. **Grass**\\n   - **Resource Provided:** None directly, but it can be used to grow plants.\\n   - **Requirement:** None for interaction, but you need a sapling to plant.\\n\\n2. **Cow**\\n   - **Resource Provided:** Meat when defeated, which can be eaten to restore health.\\n   - **Requirement:** You need to approach and defeat the cow to collect meat.\\n\\nThese objects are part of the environment you can interact with to gather resources and progress in the game.', 'Based on the current situation and objectives, here are the top two actions the player should take:\\n\\n1. **Move Left (Priority: 5)**\\n   - **Requirement:** Flat ground west of the agent.\\n   - **Reasoning:** Moving left will allow the player to approach the cow, which is 3 steps to the north and 3 steps to the west. Collecting the cow is crucial for restoring health.\\n\\n2. **Move Up (Priority: 4)**\\n   - **Requirement:** Flat ground north of the agent.\\n   - **Reasoning:** After moving left, moving up will help the player get closer to the cow, facilitating its collection for health restoration.', 'Yes, the last player action \"Move West\" succeeded. The player moved to a new location where they observed grass and a cow 3 steps to the north and 3 steps to the west. There were no indications of failure or obstacles preventing the movement.', 'The last action taken by the player was \"Move West.\" This action was chosen based on the observation that there was grass 1 step to the west, and it was the preferred action with a 99% chance.', 'move_left']\n",

Based on your current observation, you should move west, as there is grass in that direction, which might lead to trees.\\n\\n2. **Collect Wood:**\\n   - Once you reach a tree, use the \"Do\" action to chop it down and collect wood. Ensure you have enough inventory space to store the wood.\\n\\nBy following these steps, you\\'ll be able to gather the wood necessary for crafting tools, which is crucial for progressing in the game.', 'Based on your current situation and objectives, here are the top three sub-tasks you should focus on, along with their priority ratings:\\n\\n1. **Collect Wood**\\n   - **Priority:** 5/5\\n   - **Reason:** Wood is a fundamental resource needed to craft essential tools like a wood pickaxe and wood sword. Without wood, you cannot progress to crafting more advanced tools or weapons.\\n\\n2. **Craft a Wood Pickaxe**\\n   - **Priority:** 4/5\\n   - **Reason:** Once you have collected enough wood, crafting a wood pickaxe is crucial for gathering stone, which is necessary for crafting more advanced tools and weapons.\\n\\n3. **Defeat a Cow**\\n   - **Priority:** 3/5\\n   - **Reason:** Defeating a cow will provide meat, which can restore health. This is important for maintaining your health status, especially as you prepare to gather resources and craft tools.\\n\\nThese tasks are prioritized based on the immediate need to gather resources and prepare for crafting, which are essential for progressing in the game.', \"Let's evaluate whether the requirements for interacting with each object are met based on your current status and inventory:\\n\\n1. **Grass**\\n   - **Requirements for Interaction:** None directly, but you need a sapling to plant.\\n   - **Current Status:** Requirements are not met for planting, as you do not have a sapling in your inventory.\\n\\n2. **Cow**\\n   - **Requirements for Interaction:** A weapon to defeat the cow.\\n   - **Current Status:** Requirements are not met, as you do not have a weapon in your inventory.\\n\\n3. **Skeleton**\\n   - **Requirements for Interaction:** A weapon to defeat the skeleton.\\n   - **Current Status:** Requirements are not met, as you do not have a weapon in your inventory.\\n\\nIn summary, you currently do not have the necessary items to interact with any of these objects effectively.

This aligns with the objective of collecting resources and progressing in the game.\\n\\n2. **Move Up (move_up)**\\n   - **Priority:** 4\\n   - **Requirement:** Flat ground north of the agent.\\n   - **Reasoning:** Moving up will bring the player closer to the cow, which can be chased and eaten to restore health. This action supports the objective of ensuring a steady food supply and maintaining health.\\n\\nThese actions prioritize exploration and resource acquisition, which are crucial for crafting tools and progressing in the game.\", 'Yes, the last player action \"move_left\" succeeded. This is evident from the change in the player\\'s observation from Step 7 to Step 8, where the player\\'s position shifted from facing grass in the south to facing grass in the west.
